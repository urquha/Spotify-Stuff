To start run the command `poetry install`.


Create a file named `.env` and populate with the following:
```
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=<spotipy-redirect-uri>
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=<spotipy-client-id>
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=<spotipy-client-secret>
```

To run the code type into the terminal `make run`.

Copy the url from the browser it puts you on into your terminal.

I've used pandas dataframes instead of a database but it is slow so could be better way
